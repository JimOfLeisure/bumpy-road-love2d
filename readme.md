# Bumpy Road

I feel like toying with a game engine and submitting to an Itch.io jam, namely [2021 Variety Megajam](https://itch.io/jam/variety-megajam-2021). I'm going to start with [Love2d's physics tutorial](https://love2d.org/wiki/Tutorial:Physics) code to get the feel for it and then try to make something from there.

My early thoughts are to have a ball roll down a procedurally-generated hill. I'm not sure how I'll turn that into a game, but hey I gotta start somewhere.
